# Intelligent PDF & General Query Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an intelligent chatbot capable of answering both general questions and queries based on the content of uploaded PDFs. It was created approximately 3â€“4 months ago for a client. The chatbot uses **SentenceTransformer** (`paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for understanding user queries and **Qwen-1.5-72B-Chat** for generating detailed responses. The interface allows users to upload PDFs, interact with the content, and receive chatbot responses, along with the option to download logs.

- **Log Download**: Users can download chat logs in JSON format for future reference.
